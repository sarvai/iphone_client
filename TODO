Higher priority:
* Add some kind of security so random web bots don't start taking photos (at
  least HTTP Basic)
* Disable camera sound if possible
* Add license, include GCDWebServer's license
* Disable rotation since UI doesn't handle it right now
* Add some kind of error handling--currently some are swallowed and some make
  the web server send empty 500 replies.

Nice to have, maybe:
* Allow selection of which camera to use in UI
* Allow selection of image quality in UI and/or as HTTP request parameter
